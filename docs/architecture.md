# Architecture

## Overview

[backend-crons](https://github.com/AbstractPlay/backend-crons) is a Serverless Framework v3 service (`abstract-play-backend-crons`) deployed to AWS `us-east-1`. All functions are Node.js 20 Lambdas triggered by EventBridge cron rules (prod only).

There is no API Gateway — these are batch and maintenance jobs only.

## Lambda functions

Defined in [`serverless.yml`](../serverless.yml). Schedules are **daily** unless noted (EventBridge `cron(0 H * * ? *)` = every day at hour H UTC).

| Function | Schedule (UTC, prod) | Role |
|----------|----------------------|------|
| `dumpdb` | Daily 00:00 | Export prod DynamoDB to S3 |
| `records` | Daily 03:00 | Build game records from dump |
| `records-ttm` | Daily 03:00 | Per-player time-to-move arrays |
| `records-move-times` | Daily 03:00 | Move activity histograms |
| `records-cooccur` | Daily 03:00 | PMI co-occurrence for recommendations |
| `records-rec-analytics` | Daily 03:00 | Recommendation impression funnel analytics (ops S3) |
| `tournament-data` | Daily 03:00 | Tournament summaries from dump |
| `records-manifest` | Daily 04:00 and 07:30 | S3 listing + `_manifest.json` v2 |
| `summarize` | Daily 06:00 | Site analytics from `ALL.json` |
| `player-summary-fanout` | Daily 06:15 | SQS fan-out for `player/*-summary.json` |
| `player-summary-worker` | SQS-triggered | Writes one player summary slice per message |
| `starttournaments` | Daily 10:00 and 22:00 | Start/cancel tournaments, create games |
| `standingchallenges` | Daily 00:00 and 12:00 | Process preset standing challenges |

See [Records pipeline](/crons/pipeline/) and [Functions reference](/crons/functions/) for details.

## Gameslib Lambda layer

Functions that call `@abstractplay/gameslib` attach the `abstractplayGameslib` layer, built by [`scripts/build-layers.mjs`](https://github.com/AbstractPlay/backend-crons/blob/develop/scripts/build-layers.mjs) before packaging:

- Bundles `@abstractplay/gameslib` and `@abstractplay/recranks` into `.serverless/layers/abstractplay-gameslib`
- Strips `@abstractplay/renderer` (transitive dep, not needed at runtime)
- Prunes docs and tests from the layer to stay under Lambda size limits; retains the supported gameslib locale bundles for localized game names

esbuild marks `@abstractplay/gameslib` and `@abstractplay/recranks` as **external** so they resolve from the layer at runtime, not from the function bundle.

    recanalytics --> s3ops[(private ops S3)]
    live --> ddb
    s3rec --> cf[CloudFront CDN]
```

## IAM permissions

The service role grants:

- **DynamoDB** — query/scan/get/put/update/delete, batch write, point-in-time export
- **S3** — list/get on `abstractplay-db-dump`; put on `records.abstractplay.com` and dump bucket; get/put on private ops bucket (`recommendations/analytics/*`)
- **SES** — send email (tournament notifications)
- **CloudFront** — gzip + cache headers on records CDN (see [S3 outputs](/crons/s3-outputs/#cloudfront-and-caching)); no blanket invalidation

## Environment

| Variable | Source | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `ABSTRACT_PLAY_TABLE` | `serverless.yml` | `abstract-play-{stage}` — used by `summarize` (geo stats), live crons, and `records-rec-analytics` |

## Dependencies

| Package | Used by | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `@abstractplay/gameslib` | records, records-ttm, records-move-times, summarize, player-summary-fanout, rating-change-notifications, starttournaments | `GameFactory`, `gameinfo`, `genRecord`, `addResource` |
| `@abstractplay/recranks` | records, summarize | `APGameRecord`, ELO/Glicko2/Trueskill raters |
| `ion-js`, `fflate` | dump consumers | Parse gzipped ION export files |
| `i18next` | records, starttournaments, inactive-challenge-cleanup | Email copy (`apback` namespace) |

`records-cooccur` uses `ion-js` and `fflate` only (no gameslib layer).
